An idea to make a TUI music player that gets music data from [music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com) and streams music. \
This app is named after a One Piece character aka [Brook](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Brook), who is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates.

There are going to be somewhat like 5 views:

- Player View
